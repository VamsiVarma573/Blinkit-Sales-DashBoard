📊 Data Model and Architecture

The Power BI data model connects multiple datasets — such as Orders, Products, Customers, and City Performance — using relational keys.

Orders Table: Contains transactional data (order ID, date, quantity, price, profit).

Products Table: Includes product details and category information.

Customer Table: Holds customer demographics and feedback ratings.

City Table: Represents delivery and regional performance data.

Relationships are established using keys like:

Customer ID → Customer Table

Product ID → Products Table

Date → Calendar Table

This model ensures that KPIs can be sliced and filtered dynamically by time, city, or category.
